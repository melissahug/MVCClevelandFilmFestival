The Cleveland Film Festival
www.clevelandfilm.org
I believe that this site would be able to incorporate MVC to allow members to offers festival ideas, movies suggestions, film votes and store the volunteer and staff information in a secure database.
Currently, all information is collected from different web applications. Utilizing MVC would all staff, members and volunteers to have one location to securely log-in. Staff would have a more unified way to know what festival suggestions is most frequent, change contact information for staff and volunteers and know what movie has the most votes.
From the point of view of the staff and volunteers, they would only need to log into one location to do anything that involves the film festival. This reduces the need for multiple passwords, clutter in their email and eliminates having their information sent to 3rd party vendors.
